      <!-- 1–2 with sub-points -->
      <ol class="mb-3">
        <li>
          Identify the father of Governor John Endecott (1588–1665)
          <ul class="mt-2">
            <li>Is it Thomas Endecott (1566–1621) of Chagford, England?</li>
            <li>Maybe one of Thomas Endecott’s (b. 1566) siblings?</li>
            <li>Maybe a distant relative of Thomas Endecott (b. 1566)?</li>
            <li>Could it be a man with an unknown surname?</li>
            <li>Could Gov. John Endecott be a descendant of the Yorkshire Endeacotts (“ae” spelling)?</li>
            <li>Some have claimed Gov. John’s parents were from Dorchester, England—another possibility?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Identify the family lines of various Endecott families from around the world
          <ul class="mt-2">
            <li>Variant spellings: Endecott, Endicott, Endacott, Indicott, Endeacott, …</li>
            <li>Large groups in the USA, England, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, …</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <!-- Continue numbering at 5 exactly as provided -->
      <ol start="5" class="mb-0">
        <li>Rule out whether certain families only took on the Endecott surname when surnames were required</li>
        <li>Compare all Endecott family lines and determine where they fit into the haplogroup tree</li>
        <li>Determine places of origin associated with submitted DNA samples</li>
        <li>Determine the specific branch the tester belongs to</li>
        <li>Determine if other surnames are associated with the Endecott surname</li>
        <li>Determine if the tester is genetically related to others who share the Endecott (and variations) surname</li>
      </ol>

        <strong>New to yDNA?</strong> Only males can take a Y-DNA test; it traces the direct paternal line and places you in a haplogroup. Big&nbsp;Y-700 gives the best resolution for this project.

        Male descendants are crucial in determining the ancestors of Gov. John Endecott.
        yDNA is passed from father to son with small mutations that accumulate over generations,
        enabling us to place each male in the correct haplogroup and subgroup.

        Males need to test their yDNA at Family Tree DNA to participate.
        Take the highest yDNA marker test you can afford — the <strong>Big&nbsp;Y-700</strong> gives the best results.
      </p>
      <p>If you can’t afford a higher test, start with a lower one. You may be asked later to add a SNP test.</p>
