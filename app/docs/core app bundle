Routes sample

config/ROUTES_SAMPLE.rb you can paste/merge into config/routes.rb

Install notes

INSTALL_NOTES.md with steps

Use this bundle as your “known good” baseline:

Unzip into your app root (it won’t overwrite your config/routes.rb; it gives you a sample file).

Merge config/ROUTES_SAMPLE.rb into your actual config/routes.rb.

Restart Rails and hit /articles/new, /sources/new, /soldiers/new.

If you want, I can also roll this into your mega bundle, but I figured you’d want a clean, minimal set you can trust first.
