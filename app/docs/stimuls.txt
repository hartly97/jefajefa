I'm not really familiar with Stimulus yet. what does this mean? data-action points to involvement-form#add

Totally fair question! In Stimulus, data-action="click->involvement-form#add" means:

“When this element is clicked, call the add method on the Stimulus controller whose identifier is involvement-form.”

Here’s the 10-second map from files → HTML:

File name: app/javascript/controllers/involvement_form_controller.js

Controller identifier: involvement-form (file snake_case → hyphenated)

Attach the controller: data-controller="involvement-form" on some container

Call a method on an event: data-action="click->involvement-form#add"

Expose elements as “targets”: data-involvement-form-target="form" → this.formTarget

Pass small params from HTML: data-involvement-form-id-param="123" → event.params.id
