Quick Stimulus cheatsheet (for your future self)

Controller identifier = file name without _controller.js, snake_case → hyphen-case.
involvement_form_controller.js → involvement-form.

data-controller = attach a controller instance to an element.
Descendants can call its methods with data-action.

data-action = “on EVENT, call CONTROLLER#METHOD”.
Always write the event explicitly: click->involvement-form#add.

Targets = named handles to elements inside the controller’s scope.
data-involvement-form-target="list" → this.listTarget.

Params = tiny values attached to the eventing element.
data-involvement-form-id-param="42" → event.params.id === "42".

Make sure it’s registered (Importmap):
run bin/rails stimulus:manifest:update once after adding new controllers, then hard refresh.
