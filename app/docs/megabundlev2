The views were included earlier in the smaller FULL_CORE_APP_BUNDLE_v2.zip — that had minimal working forms for Articles, Sources, and Soldiers, plus the _citations/fields partial.

So:

✅ Use MEGA_BUNDLE_UNIFIED_FINAL.zip for the code + docs/checklists (models/controllers/concerns/routes).

✅ Use FULL_CORE_APP_BUNDLE_v2.zip for the starter views — just copy the app/views/ folder from that zip into your app, then merge or tweak them as needed.

👉 If you’d rather not juggle two zips, I can generate you a new unified zip that includes everything together: views + controllers + models + concerns + docs/checklists. That way you’ve got one canonical bundle with nothing missing.

Want me to make that full “one stop shop” bundle?
